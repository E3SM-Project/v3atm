Repo v3atm's NGD_v3atm branch can only run F20TR_chemUCI-Linozv3 compset
because the changes brought in to enable chemUCI-Linozv3 are active,
cannot be switched off. The code base has not been made back compatible with
standard E3SM codes. As a result, E3SMv2 standard compset are not able to run.

Therefore, to support developer and integration testings, the tests 
set to use compset F20TR_chemUCI-Linozv3.  Settings specified in run 
script by v3atm developers may also be included in this testmod. 

Turn off RTM, typically for use with ERS and ERP tests.
